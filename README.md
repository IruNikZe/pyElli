# pyElli
PyElli is a numerical solver for spectral ellipsometry employing well-known 2x2 and 4x4 algorithms.
It is intended for a broad case of problems including simple fitting of layered structures, anisotropic layers and any other light interaction with layered 1D structures.
It serves as a system for the day to day ellipsometry task at hand and makes fitting a breeze.
